art-py
======

Simple tool that walks through your music library and downloads album art from
these repositories (in order)

* iTunes
* Last.fm

The plan is to add more later and allow the user to choose the order (in a way
other than changing the source code)

Usage
-----
This is probably going to change, but currently its:

    python album_art.py </path/to/your/music>

Limitations
-----------
As far as I can think of, the only major limitation is weird directory
structures and not being able to change covers. Will clear this up though
